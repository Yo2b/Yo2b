🔍 Job regex: **(staff|senior) software engineer (Rust)?**\
💼 **Available remotely**, other setups may be discussed\
💻 **20-year work experience** in software engineering and decentralised/distributed systems\
🎓 Master's degree in computer science and information technology (Grande Ecole)\
💰 Eager to enhance my experience to serve your business

🍽️ <u>What I can offer</u>:
- get your brand new software project off the ground, at all stages:
  - design, development, integration, deployment, operation, monitoring, maintenance
- dive into your software code base to:
  - develop new features
  - refactor existing ones
  - improve code quality
  - challenge robustness & safety
  - boost performance
  - optimise resources
  - spot bottlenecks
  - upgrade dependencies
  - track down technical debt
- proficiently read / write code in many languages:
  - _Rust_, _C++_, _NodeJS_, _Javascript_, _Java_, _Python_, _Lua_, _Bash_, _SQL_
- bring you expertise in decentralised/distributed systems and microservices in modern stacks
- share strong experience in (geographic) information systems, software architecture, data acquisition/distribution/streaming
- broaden my knowledge and delve into new exciting fields: AI, cybersecurity, SDV, web3
- provide your development team with mentorship / technical leadership

💡 <u>Why we should meet</u>:
- you're deeply convinced that _Rust_ is a cutting-edge language to avoid usual pitfalls of strongly-typed, low-level languages 🦀
- you want to build a new application and you already know that _Rust_ is the only reasonable way to achieve it
- you developed an application but it needs to be redesigned in _Rust_
- you've already developed a proven _Rust_-powered application and need to evolve, improve or maintain it 
- you already developed major standard _C_/_C++_ libraries and you can't afford to rebuild everything from scratch, don't worry: a thin layer of _Rust_ brings years of development and expertise to safer, higher-level applications
- you want to explore field of possibilities, demonstrate proof of concept, provide training, or evangelise about _Rust_
- despite all the reasons above, _Rust_ is out of scope but you're still interested in some other skills I've demonstrated in my track record
